Open Educational Ressources from Jupyter Notebooks
===================================================

Welcome to this brief Introduction on how to create Open Educational Ressources (OER) using Jupyter Notebooks combined with tools like GitHub and Sphinx.
The concepts presented here are based on a series of OER created by `Sascha Spors`_ et al. and used in his bachelor and master courses at the University of Rostock, Germany.
You can find an example `here`_ and read more about the concept in the corresponding paper: `Concept and Realization of Open Educational Resources using Jupyter`_


A `cookiecutter`_ template is provided and introduced as a good starting point for your OER project.
