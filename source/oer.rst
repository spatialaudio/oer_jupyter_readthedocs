`Open Educational Ressources (OER)`_ are materials intended for learning or teaching purposes, that are provided under open licenses.
This includes all forms of media, as well as tools and software.

They are further defined by the 5R criteria proposed by `David Wiley`_.
According to which one must be able to:

    * Retain - make and control copies
    * Reuse - for any purpose
    * Revise - modify or improve
    * Remix - combine with other materials 
    * Redistribute - share copies of original and revised materials

the materials freely. 

The motivation behind OER is to provide free access to high-quality education to everyone. This helps in lessening global inequalities when it comes to educational opportunities.
OERs can be beneficial on all levels of education.

Overview OER with Jupyter?
--------------------------

Jupyter Notebooks and the surrounding ecosystem of tools can provide a good starting point for creating OER. 
This is especially true for topics where the use of Jupyter Notebooks is already well established like signal processing, data science and statistics.
Notebooks allow for executable, interactive code and explanatory texts including figures and interactive elements to be combined in a single document.

Notebooks can be converted to html or pdf for static viewing or used interactivly through services such as binder without the need for a local installation.

The materials can be distributed through GitHub, which also provides tools for colaborative refinement.
